NOTE

- You may notice that I remove something. I purposely removed the button when creating a new todo list because I find it redundant
- I also add some GSAP animation as well as Sortable.js to make thing look cool
- Also, I used GSAP timeline not only to animate elements but to remove elements by declaring a function inside it. You'll see
